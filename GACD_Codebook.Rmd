##Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

###The data table to be analyzed is constructed in the following way:

1. The "test set" of accelerometer data is read in from the file "UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt"
2. The "activity codes" describing which activity is being performed are read from the file "UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt" and appended as an additional column
3. The "subject codes" describing which subject is being recorded are read from the file "UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt" and appended as an additional column

The same steps are performed for the "train" data set under "UCI HAR Dataset/train":
4. The "train set" of accelerometer data is read in from the file "UCI HAR dataset/train/X_train.txt"
5. The "activity codes" describing which activity is being performed are read from the file "UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt" and appended as an additional column
6. The "subject codes" describing which subject is being recorded are read from the file "UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt" and appended as an additional column

7. The test-set rows and train-set rows are combined into a single data frame
8. The column names obtained from "UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt" are assigned to the data, along with headings for "activity" (1-5) and "subject_ID" (1-30).
9. A new data frame, "edata", was constructed for only those columns containing the words "mean" or "stdev"
10. Activity and subject_id were made into factors

This data frame is used to summarize the results of the accelerometer readings.
